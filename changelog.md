# Changelog

## v1.6.1

Date: 2026-05-31

This maintenance bump separates staging work merged after v1.6.0 so the next stable release changelog can collect it cleanly.

### Release Metadata
- Updated app, Horde client, bundled extension, package, lockfile, and test metadata to 1.6.1.

### Merged Staging PRs
- PR #155 (2026-05-24) `fix: chat scroll and prompt manager scroll position issues`
- PR #158 (2026-05-24) `feat: add mobile navigation customization`
- PR #159 (2026-05-24) `fix: Make message generation glow theme-aware`

## v1.6.0

Date: 2026-05-18

This update consolidates the v1.6.0 staging work since v1.5.3: preset and connection profile save reliability, full-chat navigation and search, mobile bottom-bar and drawer polish, chat completion tabs, pre-generation agent interceptors, iOS streaming stabilization, context-depth controls, character-menu rework, runtime update hardening, and release documentation automation.

### Character Cards
- fix(cards): warn when card HTML contains stripped `<script>`/`<iframe>` blocks (#94).
- feat(cards): add opt-in sandboxed execution for supported card scripts (#94).

### Presets And Connection Profiles
- Connection profile changes now serialize in order, abort superseded applications cleanly, save only after the latest selected profile finishes applying, and expose expanded summaries for easier review.
- OpenAI preset changes now expose an awaitable completion path and ignore stale async preset applications, keeping linked provider and model settings from being overwritten by older selections.
- Preset slash-command and welcome flows now wait for the active preset manager to finish applying supported preset changes before continuing.
- Connection profile create, update, delete, reload, and profile slash commands now flush settings immediately so rapid preset/API swaps persist reliably, including OpenRouter quantizations on profile requests.
- Preset saves now confirm before overwriting saved prompt text, and unsaved preset text edits warn before they are discarded.
- OpenAI preset saves and imports now carry `bias_presets`, so selected logit bias libraries and their editable entries persist with the preset instead of snapping back to the base file.

### Chat Loading And Search
- Re-applied chat scroll anchoring across staging and main so scrolling upward no longer skips earlier messages.
- Disabled native chat scroll anchoring on macOS browsers so it no longer fights SillyBunny's scroll preservation while users scroll through older messages.
- Existing chats now force-scroll to the latest message on initial load across desktop and mobile, while streaming and other non-forced chat scrolling still respect auto-scroll preferences and mobile manual-scroll suppression.
- Bottom chat navigation now includes go-to-top and go-to-bottom controls for the active chat.
- Bottom-bar chat search stays synchronized with desktop and mobile chat search controls, searches the full chat data including hidden or not-yet-rendered messages, and reports whether matches are visible, hidden, data-only, or absent.
- Mobile chat scrolling stays anchored while loading older messages or dragging SillyBunny shell tabs, with tab scrolling constrained horizontally to avoid page jumps.

### Mobile Shell, Bottom Bar, And Streaming
- Added a mobile-only collapse button that hides or restores the second-row chat actions, preserves 44px touch targets, and remembers the collapsed state across reloads.
- Moved bottom chat search behind a second-row search icon so the full search field only expands when requested, then placed that search icon directly before the trash action in the expanded row.
- Kept the mobile chat dropdown on the left with up/down controls beside it while the single collapse control hides the additional actions row.
- Fixed the mobile bottom chat bar breakpoint and first-row grid sizing so controls no longer overlap on wider phone and tablet layouts, while the desktop bar stays unchanged and mobile persona, chat select, action, and search controls stay symmetrical.
- Centered the visible mobile action row when it is shown.
- Polished shell menu focus, mobile controls, mobile prompt editor layout, advanced formatting mobile headers, and mobile navigation accessibility.
- Restored mobile composer auto-grow behavior and release mobile inputs correctly after closing the character drawer.
- Reduced iOS streaming pressure, aligned smooth-streaming checks, unblocked cancelled streams, and added stability toggles for narrow mobile streaming surfaces.

### Chat Completion Tabs
- Added the default Chat Completion Tabs extension for provider-specific chat completion controls.
- Added the default Prompt Inspector extension for inspecting and editing chat completion and text completion prompts before they are sent.
- Preserved tab content and scroll positions while switching, disabling, or scrolling through chat completion tabs.
- Omitted disabled `top_k` controls and sampler-owned chat completion controls from places where they should not be saved or shown.
- Honored connection profile secret IDs for custom chat completions so profile-backed secrets remain linked correctly.

### In-Chat Agents And Context Tools
- Added pre-generation agent interceptors with mutation preservation, validation hardening, and visible intercept history.
- Polished in-chat agent rewrite metadata so generated rewrites are easier to inspect and track.
- Added OOC and HTML context-depth controls, then normalized the related context-depth settings.
- Added Guided Correction to Guided Generations and a Prompt Manager preview for inspecting prompt output before use.
- Refreshed the Memory Sharding quick reply with dedupe and force-update handling, then normalized icon picker search behavior.

### Message Actions And Sampling Controls
- Hid disabled extension message actions instead of leaving unavailable controls visible.
- Hid Claude sampler omission toggles when they are not active for the selected backend path.
- Added `xhigh` reasoning effort and renamed the `auto` reasoning effort label to blank.
- Kept sampling cleanup scoped to the controls it owns.

### Character Menu And Drawer
- Reworked the character menu, compacted mobile character drawer chrome, and rotated the related service-worker, shell, and static asset cache keys so iOS WebKit clients load the updated drawer instead of stale cached files.
- Restored horizontal scrolling in the mobile character tab strip so more of the character list is visible immediately on phones.
- Centered the desktop Characters drawer section tabs while preserving the mobile horizontal-scroll layout and touch behavior.

### Character Editor
- Character alternate greetings now save from the live editor contents, so edited greetings persist instead of falling back to stale array state.

### Bundled Extensions, Templates, And Styles
- Baked workflow extensions into the core bundle and treated Bunny Preset Tools as a bundled extension.
- Bundled Echo, Whisper, Hush, Ripple, and Tide chat styles natively.
- Improved Pathfinder settings and retrieval before retiring the Pathfinder agent from the categorized templates browser.
- Removed Prompt Inspector and Chat Completion Tabs from Launchpad after bundling them natively.

### Runtime, Updates, And Docs
- Bun launchers now retry dependency installs without `--frozen-lockfile` if the locked install fails, so users no longer need to delete `bun.lock` after an update.
- Clean Git checkouts restore the tracked `bun.lock` after a local Bun lockfile refresh so future launcher self-updates are not blocked by a dirty lockfile.
- Server admin status, update, and branch handling now supports linked Git worktrees and stable branch tracking for runtime worktrees.
- Docker startup regressions were fixed, and Webpack now aliases Chevrotain to its prebundled ESM file.
- Added the server hygiene lesson, refreshed agent repository notes, and applied documentation polish from staging follow-ups.

### Reverted Before Release
- PR #47, the topbar repository logo experiment, was merged and then reverted before v1.6.0 shipped.
- PR #48, the Claude disable-`top_k` option, was merged and then reverted before v1.6.0 shipped.

### Release Metadata
- The welcome panel now uses the dynamic current-release label instead of a stale hardcoded 1.4.2 eyebrow.
- Updated app, Horde client, bundled extension, package, lockfile, and README metadata to 1.6.0.
- Added a `changelog:merged-prs` script and GitHub workflow so future merged staging PRs are recorded in `changelog.md` automatically.

## v1.5.3

Date: 2026-05-03

This update adds the Black Orange theme and desktop character drawer tiles, improves managed shell coexistence, restores Moving UI control over the character drawer size, and quiets expected Pathfinder sidecar aborts.

### Mobile UI Polish
- Restored chat scroll anchoring so scrolling up no longer skips over batches of earlier messages.
- Lengthened the slim mobile Persona bottom chat bar to match the Image #2 near-full-width footprint while preserving its compact height.
- Slimmed the mobile Persona bottom chat bar so the Bottom Bar Size slider can make it visually thinner while keeping the controls centered in one row.
- Narrowed the mobile Persona bottom chat bar so it no longer spans edge-to-edge on phone and landscape mobile layouts.
- Made the mobile Persona bottom chat bar even narrower, mobile-only, horizontal, and tied the compact width to the existing Bottom Bar Size slider.
- Recentered the Prompt Manager close, undo, and save icon buttons in the prompt editor footer.
- Let the Presets "Independent mode" helper copy wrap inside the mobile panel without being clipped, while keeping its checkbox and label aligned.
- Bumped the affected stylesheet cache keys so the mobile and prompt editor CSS updates are loaded by existing browsers.

### Provider Model Picking
- Added searchable Model ID inputs for Claude, AI21, Cohere, Perplexity, Vertex AI, Custom, and Z.AI providers by filtering each provider's Available Models list as the user types.
- Added favorite buttons for editable provider model IDs, reusing the existing per-provider model favorites store and pinning favorites at the top of the matching provider list.
- Kept typed custom model IDs available even when they are not returned by an API model list.

### Pathfinder
- Pathfinder automatic retrieval now waits for pipeline or sidecar lookup to finish before the main writing prompt is injected, while real cancellation still aborts retrieval.
- Contextual Pathfinder lorebooks now include chat, persona, character card/primary, extra character, and group member lorebooks without requiring manual Pathfinder selection or vectorization.
- Memory Summaries now keep the summary tool toggle off when disabled, accept intervals down to 2 messages, and offer a Create Summary action that writes through the Pathfinder summary lorebook path.
- Diagnostics now refresh tool registrations before checking state, read enabled tools from the active Pathfinder agent, and avoid false all-tools-disabled reports.
- Tightened Pathfinder mobile Pipeline Settings spacing and kept Diagnostics content/action alignment left in the settings panel.
- Duplicate bundled Pathfinder agents are cleaned up while preserving the automatic `tpl-pathfinder` agent.
- Pathfinder summary prompts are injected after retrieval prompt keys so the summary tool request no longer precedes retrieved context.

### In-Chat Agents
- Synced the Achievements Tracker and Scene Tracker template catalog entries with their updated source wording, and made bundled template reset recognize saved bundled agents after prompt wording changes.

### PR #13 SillyTavern 1.18.0 Sync
Merged PR #13 from `codex/sync-118-compatibility` into `staging` on 2026-05-05. GitHub and the local merge both reported the PR as conflict-free.

- Kept SillyBunny's Bun-first defaults and port `4444` while updating Node-compatible dependency and lockfile state for the SillyTavern 1.18.0 surface.
- Updated launcher and Electron package files for the new runtime layout.
- Preserved fork defaults and avoided tracked `data/default-user/**` state.
- Added account-version session handling, password/recovery hardening, trusted proxy validation, private request filtering, basic-auth rate limiting, forwarded-header helpers, cache busting, and immutable data-root override support.
- Preserved SillyBunny session auth and HTTPS behavior while adopting compatible upstream hardening.
- Updated OpenRouter, OpenAI, NanoGPT, MiniMax, Workers AI, Kobold/KoboldCpp, NovelAI, Stable Diffusion, tokenizer, speech, vector, and text/chat completion paths.
- Added Workers AI vector UI controls and fixed OpenRouter PKCE browser encoding.
- Adopted required upstream 1.18.0 UI and JavaScript compatibility changes without replacing SillyBunny's shell/navigation structure.
- Added extension lifecycle compatibility, third-party extension warning flow, streaming display utilities, persona slash commands and events, provider settings updates, popup validation, swipe picker updates, and welcome panel templates.
- Kept mobile and desktop parity in scope for newly merged UI controls, especially settings rows, vector controls, and extension flows.
- Brought in or updated unit coverage for private request filtering, prompt converters, Tavern card validation, and utility behavior.
- PR verification before merge reported passing lint, unit tests, diff whitespace checks, and Node/Bun startup smokes.

### Themes And Character Drawer
- Added the Black Orange theme.
- Added desktop character drawer tile styling for the SillyBunny tabs layout.

### Shell And Moving UI
- Opening Customize no longer closes an already-open Workspace or Agents shell, and opening Workspace or Agents no longer closes Customize.
- Moving UI now keeps control of the character drawer position and size instead of being overridden by SillyBunny desktop drawer sizing.
- Disabled the SillyBunny character drawer resize handle while Moving UI is active so the upstream drag/resize controls remain the single source of truth.
- Preserved Launchpad highlighting when the SillyBunny shell reinitializes so Moonlit Echoes and Guided Generations toast actions open the correct Launchpad cards.
- Center-aligned checkbox controls and label text across desktop, mobile, OpenAI/API cards, settings cards, theme toggles, chat delete rows, and Pathfinder prompt settings.
- Aligned Character Author's Note placement controls and Custom API key controls on mobile WebKit.
- Kept the persona chat mass-delete dialog inside iOS safe areas and tightened its narrow-screen controls so the age input and presets remain reachable on mobile Safari.
- Bound the mobile chat mass-delete dialog to iOS WebKit's visual viewport, kept the overlay above app chrome during browser toolbar shifts, constrained scrolling to the dialog list, avoided mobile autofocus jumps, aligned checkbox rows, and rotated the SillyBunny shell cache keys so corrected styles load immediately.
- Made active character and chat lorebook toolbar icons glow with the active accent color so linked lorebooks are easier to spot in the character editor.
- Made Clear cookies & cache expire server-side HttpOnly session cookies as well as browser-visible cookies before reloading.
- Paused streaming autoscroll while iOS WebKit users touch or momentum-scroll the chat so mid-generation updates no longer snap the view away from the scroll position.
- Reduced live reasoning render churn on iOS WebKit so reasoning-heavy DeepSeek and GLM streams no longer overwhelm the browser during generation.
- Kept previous chat loads pinned to the bottom on iOS WebKit even when the chat list tap leaves temporary manual-scroll suppression active.
- Extended chat manual-scroll suppression to all mobile and narrow chat surfaces so Android/Termux and iOS do not fight user scrolling during streaming or history edits.
- Opened previous-message editors with scroll-preserving focus and removed mobile off-screen message containment so chat history stays anchored while editing.

### Settings Panels And Preset Prompts
- Settings panels (Customize, Presets, Workspace, etc.) now narrow alongside the chat when the chat width is reduced, matching standard SillyTavern behaviour.
- Toggling a prompt on or off inside a preset no longer jumps the scroll position back to the top; the panel stays at the user's current scroll position.

### UI Icons And Provider Models
- Replaced the Badge frontend icon with the pixel-art bunny badge shown in the latest reference image.
- Restored the Badge frontend icon to the original bunny artwork inside the peach pixel badge frame so the Shell Style preview no longer shows the distorted hand-drawn version.
- Added a Shell Style option to switch the frontend between the SillyBunny pixel icon and badge icon, including the splash screen, Home panel logo, favicon, and future system avatar messages.
- Aligned the Reverse Proxy preset row, Prompt Manager undo action, and OpenAI model favorite button with their neighboring dropdowns on desktop and mobile layouts.
- Added current OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.5-pro`, Claude `claude-opus-4-7`, and Z.AI `glm-5.1` / `glm-5v-turbo` model choices to the backend dropdowns.
- Updated related OpenAI, Claude, and Z.AI capability handling so context, reasoning, media inlining, and Claude sampling rules stay in step with the added models.

### Settings And Browser Storage
- Added a dedicated Clear cookies & cache utility action, wired through the cache-busted SillyBunny shell script so stale browser cache does not leave the button inert.

### Pathfinder And Release Metadata
- Suppressed expected `AbortError` stack traces when Pathfinder sidecar generation is cancelled by its retrieval timeout or a closed client connection.
- Kept Pathfinder prompt action buttons from collapsing into icon-only controls by wrapping visible button labels in spans.
- Restored default Pathfinder tool toggles for existing template agents with empty tool definitions and made diagnostics report the last pipeline retrieval result.
- Added `SILLYBUNNY_USE_BUN=1 bash start.sh` as the launcher override for users who want to force Bun on ARM devices.
- Kept iOS WebKit chats pinned to the bottom while regenerated replies and post-generation agent refreshes update the latest message.
- Softened the idle send button glyph so the paper-plane icon no longer reads overly bright across themes.
- Prevented DeepSeek and other web tokenizers from failing when a Bun/ARM runtime exposes an empty server-side `location.href`.
- Updated app, Horde client, bundled extension, and package metadata to 1.5.3.

### Runtime And Upstream Sync
- Aligned the startup init flow with SillyTavern 1.18 by moving the old post-install bootstrap into `src/server-init.js` and wiring launchers plus Docker startup through `bun run init`.
- Kept first-run default public-file synchronization additive so missing bundled files are copied without overwriting existing user files.
- Updated default configuration with upstream keep-alive, forwarded header, trusted proxy, private address whitelist, authentication rate-limit, and cache buster options.
- Added upstream runtime dependencies and npm install guards for safer package installation defaults.
- Pointed OpenAI Responses tests at `default/config.yaml` so they do not depend on mutable local configuration.

### Character Drawer
- Reset character drawer tag grid placement and containment so inline tags stay inside their own character rows without overlapping adjacent entries.
- Made the character drawer X close the panel completely, added a dedicated back-to-list control for edit mode, restored inline tags in mobile grid view, and reduced the mobile header height.
- Restored mobile list-view character tags, hid the edit-only header after returning to the character list, hid the mobile hotswap strip while editing, compacted the mobile editor header, and kept the FAV/ADV controls readable on narrow screens.

### In-Chat Agents
- Updated bundled Achievements Tracker reset defaults to use `[ACH|Title|Rarity|Description of the achievement]`.
- Updated bundled Scene Tracker reset defaults to use `detail: one-line sensory detail to set the current scene`.
- Prevented swipe navigation from re-running already-applied post-generation agents while preserving real new-swipe generation processing.
- Made Cancel Agent requests persist through in-flight manual runs, added a Cancel Agent action directly to running prompt-pass toasts, and prevented cancelled manual outputs from applying after they return.
- Added pre-generation prompt preview actions in the agent editor and eligible agent cards so macro-expanded prompts can be checked before sending.
- Let manual agent runs start independently in Parallel mode instead of queuing them behind other manual runs.
- Restored agent transform badges and undo/redo access after chat refreshes when the active swipe still has saved transform history.
- Deferred post-processing for new assistant messages while an agent is already working so users can keep sending or swiping without the older agent touching the newer message.

## v1.5.2

Date: 2026-04-30

This update brings Group Utilities into Launchpad, improves Moonlit Echoes and Guided Generations migration paths, restores Pathfinder access to contextual lorebooks, fixes group-chat continuity, and focuses heavily on mobile Safari chat stability.

### Launchpad And Extensions
- Added SB-GroupUtilities to Launchpad optional installs, covering group presence, group greetings, shared group context, and SendAs utilities.
- Made the legacy Moonlit Echoes migration toast persistent until dismissed or opened, with a Show in Launchpad action that highlights the Moonlit Echoes Theme card.
- Added a Guided Generations fork notice that directs existing users to the SillyBunny-compatible fork in Launchpad.
- Updated bundled SillyBunny extension version labels to 1.5.2.

### Pathfinder
- Pathfinder now includes active chat-bound, character, character extra, and persona lorebooks alongside manually selected lorebooks by default.
- Added diagnostics for manual/contextual lorebook counts and registered ToolManager tools, reducing false missing-source and enabled-tool warnings.
- Normalized candidate entry matching and added warnings when candidate JSON does not match loaded lorebook entry names.
- Added unit coverage for contextual Pathfinder lorebook merging and deduplication.

### Group Chats And Agents
- Opening the Characters drawer during a group chat now jumps to the active group edit panel.
- Group Auto Mode now re-applies the saved global toggle when opening or creating group chats, while keeping the default off until the user enables it.
- Group DM history is included for the speaking character when returning to the main group chat without exposing private context to other speakers.
- Deleting a swipe clears pending post-generation recovery state so already-run post-generation agents do not fire again.
- Agent output history popups now use a scrollable desktop layout so long diffs keep Undo and Redo controls in view.

### Chat Naming And Workspace
- Chat auto-naming now allows longer title responses and strips reasoning wrappers before parsing, making the Persona bottom-bar wand more reliable with reasoning models.
- Persona bottom-bar Auto-label Chat now uses structured title output when available and falls back to raw title parsing, preventing false `No message generated` errors.
- Workspace tabs and mobile shortcut options now place API immediately after Presets.
- CYOA Choices bundled regex now removes empty optional choice rows before rendering.

### Mobile Chat Stability
- Added lazy/async loading hints for chat avatars and attached message images.
- Chat rendering now uses smaller mobile batches, ignores duplicate older-history touch/mouse activations, and contains off-screen messages to reduce WebKit layout and memory pressure.
- Mobile message updates now batch regex/HTML post-processing while keeping generation updates immediate.
- Streaming replies now patch formatted DOM in place, restore live formatted updates when stream fade-in is disabled, and reduce repeated swipe metadata cloning.
- Send flows now render user messages before slow handoffs, server ping, or group setup, then hold bottom scroll position to avoid iOS Safari send delays and snap-backs.
- Swipe navigation now anchors relative to the chat bottom and disables browser scroll anchoring on the chat scroller.
- New-message media scrolling now watches only visible media in the latest message and caps waits at 300 ms.

### Shell And Mobile UI
- Fixed group speaker controls overflowing to the right when a typing indicator appears by allowing the desktop control row to wrap cleanly.
- The Bottom Bar Size slider now scales the SillyBunny chatbar and Persona bottom chat controls on mobile instead of only affecting the legacy composer sizing.
- Background Visibility now supports 100%, refreshes upgraded slider metadata, and keeps composer/chatbar surfaces readable at high visibility.
- Header, chatbar, composer, bottom chat surfaces, and Clean Minimal mobile drawer/menu panels now use solid layers in no-blur or high-visibility setups to prevent compositor artifacts.
- Mobile Workspace, navigation, Characters, and Quick Actions drawers now have tighter, more consistent spacing, safer bounds, and solid focused panels while keeping page context visible where intended.
- Characters drawer right-lock alignment now applies immediately on macOS desktop browsers and stays edge-flush on shorter windows without losing drag/resize behavior.
- Mobile Characters drawer layouts now use native shell bounds, safe-area gutters, aligned controls, and square avatars that avoid squeezing on narrow iOS-sized viewports.
- Mobile Top Bar Label option cards are left-aligned so checkbox, title, and helper text read cleanly in one-column settings layouts.
- Rotated the SillyBunny theme, tabs, and service-worker cache keys so browsers pick up the hardened surface styling immediately.

## v1.5.1

Date: 2026-04-29

This update restores Prose Polisher coverage for guided impersonation workflows, makes Advanced Formatting a first-class workspace tab again, adds conservative startup-loading improvements for desktop and mobile, and polishes cross-platform UI alignment, focus, safe-area, and touch-target behavior.

### In-Chat Agents
- Added an opt-in prompt-pass condition for generated impersonation text so Prose Polisher can rewrite Guided Generations impersonations without mutating the previous assistant message.
- Shipped the bundled Prose Polisher template with impersonation polishing enabled, while keeping the new behavior off by default for other prompt-pass agents.
- Added editor UI and migration support for saved bundled Prose Polisher agents, plus unit coverage for both opted-out and opted-in impersonation behavior.

### Workspace And Formatting
- Promoted Advanced Formatting into its own left workspace tab immediately after Sampling.
- Kept the Formatting tab visible across backends instead of hiding the whole Advanced Formatting drawer outside Text Completions.

### Loading
- Deferred ordered classic library scripts, preloaded startup modules, and limited the mobile stylesheet to mobile viewports.
- Added a guarded service worker that stale-while-revalidates static library, CSS, image, and webfont assets while using network-first handling for HTML and JavaScript.

### UI Polish
- Replaced clipped outer focus outlines and oversized active-control shadows with inset rings so focused and highlighted controls stay inside rounded containers.
- Aligned shell headers, character drawer padding, welcome headers, and checkbox labels across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Normalized mobile safe-area fallbacks and 44 px tap targets for the composer, bottom chat controls, and welcome recent-chat actions.
- Cleaned up redundant shell borders, trailing recent-chat stat dividers, and duplicated macOS browser chrome patches.
- Left-aligned SillyBunny shell drawer eyebrow labels, titles, subtitles, and descriptions across desktop and mobile.
- Contained shell close-button focus rings inside rounded borders so highlights no longer bleed past the control edge.
- Gave mobile Customize, Navigate, and Characters drawers a rounded native sheet treatment with a slide-up entry, handle pill, side gutters, and safe-area-aware header spacing.
- Stabilized mobile Recent Chats text sizing in WebKit with scoped text-size adjustment, stronger line-clamp bounds, and narrow-screen overflow guards.
- Tightened the mobile composer bottom spacing by removing duplicate safe-area padding and avoiding the forced 34 px fallback under the chat bar.

### Chat Management
- Narrowed the Persona bottom chat bar on mobile with safe-area-aware side gutters while leaving the message composer width unchanged.
- Tightened mobile Persona bottom bar control heights, avatar sizing, icon buttons, gaps, and narrow-phone spacing so the bar no longer dominates the screen.
- Added Persona bottom bar shortcuts for mass deleting chats in the current character/group scope and asking the active LLM to name the current chat.
- Added aligned mass-delete checkboxes, protected the currently open chat, and included 7/30/90/180 day cleanup presets plus a matching `/autonamechat` command.

This patch focuses on persistence and restart fixes for the new agentic and admin workflows introduced around `v1.5.0`.

### Chat And Reasoning
- Persisted collapsed thinking/reasoning block state per message so user-expanded or user-collapsed reasoning blocks survive chat switches and reloads.

### Pathfinder
- Added an independent Pathfinder enable switch in settings so saving books, modes, or prompt settings no longer toggles Pathfinder off unexpectedly.
- Preserved nested Pathfinder settings, including pipeline prompts, custom pipelines, book permissions, and tool confirmations, instead of resetting omitted fields back to defaults.
- Raised Pathfinder pipeline stage output limits from `1024` to `32000` tokens by default and exposed the stage max-token setting in both prompt editors.

### Server Admin
- Fixed frontend Save & Restart and update restarts when launched from the provided Linux, macOS, and Windows launchers so the server relaunches in the same terminal instead of becoming a detached silent process.

## v1.5.0

Date: 2026-04-26

This is the next main update after `v1.4.2`. It includes the new Group Chat system, rewording some UI elements, a unified Sampling workspace, improved mobile behavior, token accounting fixes, OpenAI Responses streaming fixes, In-Chat Agent fixes, RAG enablement fixes, cleaning up unnecessary dependencies, and redundant deprecated-code cleanup.

### Group Chats
Group Chats still work for normal group RP: you can pick a group, write as the user, choose who speaks next, and run the scene manually just like before. The new group chat system adds optional tools for people who want the group to feel more like a living conversation, chatroom, party scene, or auto-RP setup.

- Added a bottom group-chat control bar with active speaker selection, Speak Now, manual DM mode, Auto Mode, Auto DM, unread DM badges, and compact mobile controls.
- Added private per-character DM chats. DMs use participant-limited context, show unread badges on character avatars, can be opened with one tap, force DM mode while inside the private chat, and include Return to Group navigation.
- Added Auto Mode for scheduled or autonomous group replies, with per-group persistence, configurable delay, context-aware direct-name replies, group-wide prompts, and anti-loop limits so characters do not rapid-fire forever.
- Added Auto DM for private scheduled messages, including a separate cooldown so background DMs can happen without flooding the user.
- Added AI-generated 24-hour group schedules. SillyBunny can ask the model to create a full-day routine for the group, keep track of local time, catch up after downtime, and optionally let scheduled characters message when their entry is due.
- Improved inter-character conversation prompts so characters can answer, interrupt, agree, disagree, ask questions, or react to other participants instead of only responding to the user.
- Added an active-speaker typing indicator and clearer mobile group controls.
- Fixed group chat saving, branching, Recent Chats registration, empty new chats, custom-name reuse, Auto Mode persistence, draft preservation, unread DM alignment, DM tap targeting, and rapid-fire DM auto-replies.
- Removed redundant old group modes and controls, including Narrator Merge, One at a time, and the old Narrate Turn flow.

### Character Notes
- Made Character Author's Note (Private) editable in group chats and separated group-specific notes from individual chat notes.
- Fixed private note persistence and injection for `Use character author's note` plus `Replace`, `Top`, and `Bottom` placement.

### Workspace, Sampling, And Presets
- Added a unified Sampling menu in the Workspace menu for Chat Completions and Text Completions. This also migrates seed and logit bias information from Chat Completions to a more logical place, and includes a Neutralize Samplers button for Chat Completions.
- Updated Geechan's bundled roleplay preset to `Geechan - Universal Roleplay (Chat Completions) (v5.2)` plus matching Text Completions context and system prompt variants.
- Replaced `Geechan's Chatroom Prompt` with the overhauled `Geechan - Universal Online Chat (Chat Completions) (v1.0)` preset, plus matching Text Completions context and system prompt files.
- Updated `Pura's Director Preset (SillyBunny)` to version `13.0` and removed the separate SillyTavern variant from bundled content.
- Added roomier editing tools, including a resizable first-message field, a desktop World Info pop-up editor, expanded context-size presets, Text Completions preset parity, and better advanced definitions editing.
- Added an OpenRouter/NanoGPT-only `Unlocked Context Size` toggle in Chat Completion token budget settings, preserving SillyBunny's always-unlocked behavior for other providers.
- Fixed preset and settings layout polish, including balanced prompt manager panes, aligned prompt preset controls, equalized Presets dropdown controls, and less-clipped preset action text.
- Fixed Prompt Manager token attribution so the Main Prompt row shows the Main Prompt text itself instead of inheriting surrounding injected prompt totals.

### Chat History, Server Tools, And RAG
- Added Chat History tools for LLM-assisted chat labels, old-chat cleanup, and backup cleanup with previews, confirmations, retention filters, and mobile-friendly controls.
- Added Customize > Server thumbnail controls for format, quality, dimensions, sharp defaults, and per-user cache clearing; sharp PNG thumbnails are now the default.
- Fixed Vector Storage/RAG enablement so legacy saved flags migrate correctly and extensions can turn RAG on through live settings or the shared `SillyTavern.rag` API.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streaming so expected client disconnects and aborts stop cleanly without noisy `Responses API stream error` logs, while preserving error logging for real upstream stream failures.
- Added Responses API stream coverage for Chat Completions SSE conversion, reasoning deltas, output deltas, and abort suppression.

### In-Chat Agents
- Fixed separated Individual/Group enablement, recovered saved toggles that were missing from scoped state, and made manual agent runs queue instead of disappearing.
- Fixed automatic post-generation runs on desktop and mobile, including late mobile render timing after the generation flag clears and delayed iOS Safari page wakeups.
- Fixed mobile post-processing recovery when iOS Safari misses the generation-ended event, leaves the generation flag stuck, or replaces the rendered message object before queued agents flush.
- Fixed regex-only agents so their formatter scripts attach as soon as an assistant message is received instead of waiting for post-generation processing.
- Fixed in-chat agent regex scripts so they attach during streamed assistant replies and render immediately, matching the native Regex extension timing.
- Fixed in-chat agent post-processing recovery for regenerated assistant replies and preserved prompt-transform diff/undo controls after chat reloads.
- Fixed Impersonate handling so it is treated as user-side generation and no longer runs post-processing, fallback recovery, or regex snapshot mutation against the previous assistant message.
- Fixed prompt-transform runs, transform history, processed-run keys, regex snapshots, and undo/redo controls to use active swipe metadata instead of leaking shared message metadata across swipes.
- Scoped Prose Polisher and agent change history to the active swipe so the document icon only shows edits for the currently visible message.
- Fixed dry-run prompt previews so active pre-generation in-chat agent prompts are included before generation starts, preventing token totals from jumping when the live request begins.
- Prevented mobile render replacements from rerunning post-processing agents that already handled the same generated message.
- Hardened mobile post-processing guards so delayed automatic render/receive events cannot rerun agents after generated timestamp metadata changes.
- Fixed active-swipe regex metadata persistence through chat reloads and prevented Impersonate events from clearing it.
- Added a separate Pathfinder memory summary UI with editable summary text and injection status.
- Fixed Agents Quick Toggles overflow, Pathfinder control alignment, hidden idle cancel buttons, and Pathfinder log detail layout.

### UI And Mobile
- Added a persistent compact mode for the refreshed SillyBunny UI.
- Reworked the default desktop and mobile UI for more consistent spacing, square icon buttons, aligned drawers, normalized dropdowns, readable highlighted text, and a less cramped composer.
- Renamed Navigate to Workspace, shortened the primary character shortcut labels to `FAV.` and `ADV.`, and removed deprecated visible Extras wording.
- Fixed mobile bottom chat controls, send/stop sizing, group avatar spacing, typing indicator alignment, toggle visibility, unread DM badge visibility, avatar refresh flicker, and mobile prompt control alignment.
- Fixed chat and character UI regressions around zoomed avatars, overflowing thumbnails, individual recent chats, group-row alignment, prompt visibility eye buttons, WebKit Ripple rendering, bottom chat spacing, composer panel theming, and first-message top alignment.
- Fixed the refreshed mobile composer so the chat text box and bottom action bar stay compact on narrow screens.
- Restored compact one-line mobile Prompt Manager rows on very narrow screens by keeping prompt names, controls, and token counts aligned in a single row.
- Removed the pill-shaped background from chat message numbers while keeping timer and token metadata spacing intact.
- Fixed reasoning token accounting so locally parsed `<think>`, `<thinking>`, and `<thought>` blocks count as thought tokens while visible message token counts stay scoped to output text.
- Enlarged quick context-size preset labels on mobile and narrow panels so values such as `128 K` and `1 M` fit their buttons cleanly.
- Aligned the mobile Quick Actions menu with fixed icon and label columns so every row starts and justifies consistently.

### Extensions And Moonlit Echoes
- Removed the bundled Moonlit Echoes extension, built-in Moonlit chat stylesheet, and Echo, Whisper, Hush, Ripple, and Tide options from core Appearance.
- Kept core chat style validation to Flat, Bubbles, and Document; old saved Moonlit style values now reset to Flat and clear legacy body classes.
- Added the SillyBunny-specific Moonlit Echoes fork to Launchpad optional installs.
- Added a warning-only Moonlit Echoes update toast that points affected users to the fork without disabling or changing saved theme settings.
- Replaced the patched bundled Nemo preset extension with the SillyBunny-owned Bunny Preset Tools local extension, including saved-settings migration and no nested upstream git checkout.
- Fixed duplicate extension settings drawers so repeated extension activation does not create doubled panels.
- Fixed Moonlit Echoes fork styling so enabled Moonlit chat thumbnails and the mobile composer remain usable.

### Maintenance
- Cleaned up launcher installs so routine starts are quieter, preserve ESLint dependencies, and avoid unnecessary dependency work when runtime inputs have not changed.
- Fixed Basic auth plus account-login sessions so module assets such as `/lib.js` keep loading after login on mobile browsers, and made unauthorized auth pages non-cacheable.
- Fixed lint coverage by including `scripts/**/*.js` in the standard ESLint target and resolving the existing lint failures.
- Fixed frontend cache clearing after updater reloads.
- Removed unused deprecated server utilities for mutable config writes and direct HTTP/2 requests, including the now-unused `node:http2` import.
- Removed unused deprecated Express parser aliases that were superseded by application-level middleware.
- Removed redundant root package metadata, dropped unused direct Chevrotain types, and moved test-only ESLint plugin ownership into the nested `tests` package.
- Cleaned up test lint references so nested test lint runs without warnings or undefined globals.
- Kept `public/scripts/f-localStorage.js` in place for extension compatibility.
- Bumped app-owned version strings to `1.5.0` without changing dependency versions.
