An elegant fork of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern), designed with a cleaner, graphical shell UI; Bun-based backend; built-in tutorials, presets, extensions, and a quick-start dashboard; and a lightweight agentic system to facilitate modern agent functionality.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an in-dev fork, and is considered beta quality. [Please direct SillyBunny-specific issues to this project's issue tracker.](https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny/issues) If an issue is reproducible in upstream SillyTavern, please report it upstream instead.
>
> Disclaimer: LLMs are used to facilitate development of this fork. Overall software design, prompting, testing, and documentation are handled by humans. To keep things simple, we try to maintain close to upstream as possible.

## Installation

[Grab the latest release here.](https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny/releases/latest)

Or run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
```

Then, run the appropriate launcher for your OS, which auto-installs all dependencies, checks for updates, and starts a server instance. You can also open `http://127.0.0.1:4444` manually in your browser.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Windows | `.\Start.bat` |
| macOS (Terminal) | `./Start.command` |
| macOS (Finder) | Double-click `Start.command` (right-click > Open if Gatekeeper warns) |
| Linux / WSL | `./start.sh` |
| Docker | `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build`
| Android (Termux) | `bash start.sh` |

If you already manage your own Bun install, run via `bun run start`. Other launch variants:

```bash
bun run start:mobile   # lower-memory (--smol)
bun run start:global   # SillyBunny-owned data paths
bun run start:no-csrf  # disable CSRF (local dev)
```

### macOS notes

- If the launcher window closes too fast, run `./Start.command` from Terminal to keep output visible
- If Git is missing, the launcher triggers `xcode-select --install` automatically
- Quarantine metadata from ZIP downloads: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/SillyBunny`
- Stripped permissions from unzip: `chmod +x Start.command start.sh scripts/*.sh`

### Termux (Android) notes

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y git curl unzip
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
bash start.sh
```

- The launcher defaults to Node.js + npm on native Termux and ARM devices when Node.js is available
- To force Bun anyway: `SILLYBUNNY_USE_BUN=1 bash start.sh`
- For shared storage access: `termux-setup-storage` once before starting
  
### How to Update

| What you want | Command |
|---------------|---------|
| Update from the running app | Open Customize > Server and use the built-in updater |
| Normal launch (auto-checks for updates) | `./start.sh` |
| Force update then launch | `./start.sh --self-update` |
| Update only, don't start | `./start.sh --self-update-only` |
| Skip update check once | `./start.sh --skip-self-update` |
| Disable auto-update permanently | `SILLYBUNNY_AUTO_UPDATE=0 ./start.sh` |

## Project Goals (AKA, why we made this fork)

Our primary goals for SillyBunny are as follows:

1) **Simple by default; powerful when needed.** Directly inspired by KDE Plasma's main driving philosophy, SillyBunny is aimed to be simple to understand and intuitive to use by default, with most of the complex settings hidden away from the default workspace. Sane defaults are implemented while all the extra complexity is hidden behind UI elements: still there, but less obtrusive. Our graphical shell best embodies this philosophy.
2) **A focus on roleplay and storytelling.** SillyBunny has a more opinionated purpose compared to upstream SillyTavern. Our goals align closely with the creative writing scene for models, and the general direction of the fork is aimed for that use case. We facilitate this with pre-bundled tutorials/add-ons/presets designed to get you started with LLM creative writing in fun ways.
3) **Modernised features.** We aim to implement new features that can greatly take advantage of modern models and their strong, agentic capabilities. Currently, this includes full support for In-Chat pre and post gen agents that complement the main generation. Models work best on smaller individual tasks, and this is best shown through in-chat agents and their capabilities. We're also looking into features like an RPG game mode that can take advantage of these agents.
4) **Better performance.** Base SillyTavern relies on node.js for its runtime environment. While robust, this is not ideal for performance. We've switched to a Bun runtime to increase general performance and startup times, while optimising for lower power devices like smartphones.
5) **Compatibility**. We remain as closely backwards compatible with upstream SillyTavern as possible. This facilitates easy synchronizing with upstream. We aim to not remove any pre-existing features, unless replacing with a direct alternative. The backend is already very solid, so primary work is done in the frontend space. In addition, we aim to make all our new features compatible with models of all sizes, not just the frontier, SOTA ones. Simplicity is key.

## Changes vs. SillyTavern

### Different UI

The original SillyTavern layout is replaced with a custom, easy-to-navigate graphical shell:

- **Top bar**: Reworked with cleaner, better-defined nested menus. Includes Workspace, Customize, Home, and Characters.
- **Bottom bar**: New bottom bar designed for quick access to persona switching, quick chat switching, and add/edit/remove existing chat functionality.
- **Panel-oriented navigation**: Easy access to all settings in nested panels. Collapsible settings sections in both Chat Completions and Text Completions presets.
- **Global search**: A global search bar that queries across presets, lore, extensions, personas, and settings at once.
- **Platform-aware**: Designed for both desktop and mobile, with a dedicated phone/tablet navigation layer.
- **Three modern shell themes**: Modern Glass, Clean Minimal, Bold Stylized.
- **Palette customization**: Easily change the accent colour of any theme you're currently using.

### Bun-first runtime

We primarily use Bun as a runtime, instead of node.js. This results in consistently faster startups, overall performance, and automatic launcher bootstraping. Node.js is still fully functional as a legacy fallback system.

### In-Chat Agentic Support

SillyBunny has support for In-Chat Agents. These are custom prompt fields that can run separately from the main generation, which allows for a lot of extra flexibility. Included are several pre-built prompts designed for trackers, post-gen cleanup, anti-slop, and more. Agents can use the main model or a different connection profile, allowing for a fast, smaller model to run long agentic tasks with ease while a large, main model writes the actual story content. These are designed to fill the gap between full extensions and simple, modular agentic functionality.

**Pipeline:**

1. **Pre-generation agents** inject prompt text before the main reply is generated, or run as interceptors that rewrite the assembled outgoing context before it reaches the main model.
2. **Main Model** writes the main RP reply.
3. **Post-generation agents** optionally rewrites the contents of the main response, or appends extra content after the reply.
4. **Post-process utilities** can extract structured data, run regex cleanup/formatting, or preserve machine-readable blocks while showing cleaner UI.
5. **Groups and templates** let you swap whole stacks quickly without editing your base preset every time.

**Typical Usecases:**

- Trackers for scene, time, items, relationships, off-screen activity, and world state.
- Writing cleanup passes like anti-slop or regex-based formatting.
- Formatting helpers like direction menus, CYOA choices, or NPC profile cards.
- Randomisers and directives that change the pressure, genre, pacing, or escalation of a scene.
- Content toggles for prose style, difficulty, POV, and HTML artifacts.
- Agentic lorebook navigation for on-demand retrieval, memory maintenance, and tree building.
- Cheap helper-model passes that prepare or polish content without spending your main model's budget.

**Included Agents**

* **Trackers:** Achievements, CYOA Choices, Direction Menu, Event, Item, NPC Profiles, Parallel Off-Screen, Relationship, Reputation, Scene, Secrets, Status, Time, and World Detail.
* **Randomizers:** Chaos Mode, Combined Director's Cut, Dead Dove Escalation, Genre, Grounded Complication, Intimacy & Kink, Scene Driving Force, and Scene Pressure Cocktail.
* **Content:** Difficulty Increase, Don't Write for User, Friction Mode, Grounded Prose, HTML Toggle, NPC Motivator by Sheep, and Write for User.
* **Post Generation Editors:** Prose Polisher
* **Additional Agents:** Pathfinder (an agentic lorebook navigator with 8 tools for retrieval, memory maintenance, and tree building).

**Agent Behaviors and Settings**
* Agentic prompts feature inline run-order editing, click-to-edit functionality, and fullscreen prompt editors.
* Agents use the main connection profile by default with an 8192 max token limit. Separate connection profile support is available when explicitly selected.
* Pre-Generation Intercepts can replace the outgoing context, wrap or append helper output, or add tagged patches before the main model replies. Multiple interceptors run in agent order, and NPC Motivator by Sheep is bundled as a starter intercept template.
* Bundled trackers, including CYOA Choices, are configured for pre-generation. The main model emits clickable options directly in the response.
* All bundled tracker and menu agents default to the User injection role to maintain compatibility with models that deprioritize System injections.
* Built-in groups are available for the full preset, trackers only, and randomizers only.
* Custom agents support ST-style regex options.

### Bundled Goodies & Tutorials
SillyBunny includes some extras by default to help you get started right away:
* A tutorial that guides you through the SillyBunny interface.
* Pre-bundled roleplay presets from purachina and Geechan, including Pura's Director Preset V13.1, Geechan's Universal Roleplay V5.2, and Geechan's Universal Online Chat V1.0.
* Pre-bundled workflow extensions including Guided Generations, Input History, Quick Image Gen, and Prompt Inspector.
* A character card conversion preset from TLD to help you generate character cards from scratch, or convert from existing cards to a better format.
* A friendly quick-start guide with bundled workflow helpers plus optional recommended extensions such as Summary Sharder, Dialogue Colours, and CSS Snippets.
* Two custom assistants to help you get started - Bunny Guide, and Assistant Nahida.

## Latest Update

### v1.6.0 (2026-05-18)

This update turns the staging line after v1.5.3 into the v1.6.0 release, with new prompt tools, steadier profile and preset saves, cleaner mobile chat controls, and safer runtime updates.

**Added**
* Pre-Generation Intercepts are a new In-Chat Agents feature for running agents before the main reply, with mutation preservation, validation hardening, visible intercept history, and NPC Motivator by Sheep bundled as a starter intercept template.
* Guided Generations, Input History, Quick Image Gen, and Prompt Inspector are now pre-bundled.
* Chat Completion Tabs are bundled for provider-specific chat completion controls.
* Guided Generations now includes Guided Correction, and Prompt Manager adds a prompt preview before use.
* Prose Polisher now supports Guided Generations impersonation polishing through its bundled opt-in prompt-pass update.
* Pura's Director Preset is updated to V13.1, Geechan's Universal Roleplay presets are updated to V5.2, and Geechan's Universal Online Chat V1.0 is now bundled.
* OOC and HTML context-depth controls now make those context windows adjustable from the UI.
* Echo, Whisper, Hush, Ripple, and Tide chat styles are bundled natively.
* Reasoning options now include `xhigh`, with `auto` renamed to `None`.

**Changed**
* Connection Profiles now serialize changes in order, cancel superseded applications, await OpenAI preset updates, preserve profile secret IDs, and show expanded summaries.
* Bunny Preset Tools and preset saves now guard overwrites, warn before discarding unsaved prompt text, and persist `bias_presets` with OpenAI presets.
* Chat Loading And Search now includes full-chat search with visible, hidden, and data-only match reporting, go-to-top and go-to-bottom controls, macOS scroll anchoring fixes, and an initial-load scroll to the newest message that still respects streaming auto-scroll preferences.
* Mobile Bottom Bar now has a persisted collapse button, second-row search, left-aligned chat dropdown, adjacent up/down controls, and symmetric mobile action layout without changing the desktop bar.
* Character Menu and mobile drawer chrome are denser, cache-keyed for iOS refreshes, and keep mobile tab scrolling while centering desktop section tabs.
* Connection profile requests now preserve OpenRouter quantizations, and in-chat agent rewrite metadata is easier to inspect.
* Bumped app, Horde client, bundled extension, package, lockfile, and README metadata to 1.6.0.

**Fixed**
* Docker startup regressions, Bun lockfile recovery, clean-checkout lockfile restore, runtime worktree update handling, and the Webpack Chevrotain ESM alias are hardened.
* Advanced Formatting's mobile header, iOS streaming pressure, cancelled-stream UI recovery, and mobile composer input release after the character drawer closes are tightened.
* Memory Sharding quick replies now dedupe and force-update correctly, while disabled message actions and inactive sampler controls stay hidden.

**Removed**
* Pathfinder is retired from the active agent lineup after its settings and retrieval improvements, with the templates browser now categorized for easier discovery.
* Prompt Inspector and Chat Completion Tabs are removed from Launchpad because they are bundled natively.

### v1.5.3 (2026-05-03)

This update adds the Black Orange theme and desktop character drawer tiles, improves managed shell coexistence, restores Moving UI control over the character drawer size, and quiets expected Pathfinder sidecar aborts.

**Mobile UI Polish**
* Lengthened the slim mobile Persona bottom chat bar to match the Image #2 near-full-width footprint while preserving its compact height.
* Slimmed the mobile Persona bottom chat bar so the Bottom Bar Size slider can make it visually thinner while keeping the controls centered in one row.
* Narrowed the mobile Persona bottom chat bar so it no longer spans edge-to-edge on phone and landscape mobile layouts.
* Made the mobile Persona bottom chat bar even narrower, mobile-only, horizontal, and tied the compact width to the existing Bottom Bar Size slider.
* Recentered the Prompt Manager close, undo, and save icon buttons in the prompt editor footer.
* Let the Presets "Independent mode" helper copy wrap inside the mobile panel without being clipped, while keeping its checkbox and label aligned.
* Bumped the affected stylesheet cache keys so the mobile and prompt editor CSS updates are loaded by existing browsers.

**Provider Model Picking**
* Added searchable Model ID inputs for Claude, AI21, Cohere, Perplexity, Vertex AI, Custom, and Z.AI providers by filtering each provider's Available Models list as the user types.
* Added favorite buttons for editable provider model IDs, reusing the existing per-provider model favorites store and pinning favorites at the top of the matching provider list.
* Kept typed custom model IDs available even when they are not returned by an API model list.

**Pathfinder**
* Pathfinder automatic retrieval now waits for pipeline or sidecar lookup to finish before the main writing prompt is injected, while real cancellation still aborts retrieval.
* Contextual Pathfinder lorebooks now include chat, persona, character card/primary, extra character, and group member lorebooks without requiring manual Pathfinder selection or vectorization.
* Memory Summaries now keep the summary tool toggle off when disabled, accept intervals down to 2 messages, and offer a Create Summary action that writes through the Pathfinder summary lorebook path.
* Diagnostics now refresh tool registrations before checking state, read enabled tools from the active Pathfinder agent, and avoid false all-tools-disabled reports.
* Tightened Pathfinder mobile Pipeline Settings spacing and kept Diagnostics content/action alignment left in the settings panel.
* Duplicate bundled Pathfinder agents are cleaned up while preserving the automatic `tpl-pathfinder` agent.
* Pathfinder summary prompts are injected after retrieval prompt keys so the summary tool request no longer precedes retrieved context.

**In-Chat Agents**
* Synced the Achievements Tracker and Scene Tracker template catalog entries with their updated source wording, and made bundled template reset recognize saved bundled agents after prompt wording changes.

**PR #13 SillyTavern 1.18.0 Sync**
Merged PR #13 from `codex/sync-118-compatibility` into `staging` on 2026-05-05. GitHub and the local merge both reported the PR as conflict-free.

* Kept SillyBunny's Bun-first defaults and port `4444` while updating Node-compatible dependency and lockfile state for the SillyTavern 1.18.0 surface.
* Updated launcher and Electron package files for the new runtime layout.
* Preserved fork defaults and avoided tracked `data/default-user/**` state.
* Added account-version session handling, password/recovery hardening, trusted proxy validation, private request filtering, basic-auth rate limiting, forwarded-header helpers, cache busting, and immutable data-root override support.
* Preserved SillyBunny session auth and HTTPS behavior while adopting compatible upstream hardening.
* Updated OpenRouter, OpenAI, NanoGPT, MiniMax, Workers AI, Kobold/KoboldCpp, NovelAI, Stable Diffusion, tokenizer, speech, vector, and text/chat completion paths.
* Added Workers AI vector UI controls and fixed OpenRouter PKCE browser encoding.
* Adopted required upstream 1.18.0 UI and JavaScript compatibility changes without replacing SillyBunny's shell/navigation structure.
* Added extension lifecycle compatibility, third-party extension warning flow, streaming display utilities, persona slash commands and events, provider settings updates, popup validation, swipe picker updates, and welcome panel templates.
* Kept mobile and desktop parity in scope for newly merged UI controls, especially settings rows, vector controls, and extension flows.
* Brought in or updated unit coverage for private request filtering, prompt converters, Tavern card validation, and utility behavior.
* PR verification before merge reported passing lint, unit tests, diff whitespace checks, and Node/Bun startup smokes.

**Themes And Character Drawer**
* Added the Black Orange theme.
* Added desktop character drawer tile styling for the SillyBunny tabs layout.

**Shell And Moving UI**
* Opening Customize no longer closes an already-open Workspace or Agents shell, and opening Workspace or Agents no longer closes Customize.
* Moving UI now keeps control of the character drawer position and size instead of being overridden by SillyBunny desktop drawer sizing.
* Disabled the SillyBunny character drawer resize handle while Moving UI is active so the upstream drag/resize controls remain the single source of truth.
* Preserved Launchpad highlighting when the SillyBunny shell reinitializes so Moonlit Echoes and Guided Generations toast actions open the correct Launchpad cards.
* Center-aligned checkbox controls and label text across desktop, mobile, OpenAI/API cards, settings cards, theme toggles, chat delete rows, and Pathfinder prompt settings.
* Aligned Character Author's Note placement controls and Custom API key controls on mobile WebKit.
* Kept the persona chat mass-delete dialog inside iOS safe areas and tightened its narrow-screen controls so the age input and presets remain reachable on mobile Safari.
* Bound the mobile chat mass-delete dialog to iOS WebKit's visual viewport, kept the overlay above app chrome during browser toolbar shifts, constrained scrolling to the dialog list, avoided mobile autofocus jumps, aligned checkbox rows, and rotated the SillyBunny shell cache keys so corrected styles load immediately.
* Made active character and chat lorebook toolbar icons glow with the active accent color so linked lorebooks are easier to spot in the character editor.
* Made Clear cookies & cache expire server-side HttpOnly session cookies as well as browser-visible cookies before reloading.
* Paused streaming autoscroll while iOS WebKit users touch or momentum-scroll the chat so mid-generation updates no longer snap the view away from the scroll position.
* Reduced live reasoning render churn on iOS WebKit so reasoning-heavy DeepSeek and GLM streams no longer overwhelm the browser during generation.
* Kept previous chat loads pinned to the bottom on iOS WebKit even when the chat list tap leaves temporary manual-scroll suppression active.
* Extended chat manual-scroll suppression to all mobile and narrow chat surfaces so Android/Termux and iOS do not fight user scrolling during streaming or history edits.
* Opened previous-message editors with scroll-preserving focus and removed mobile off-screen message containment so chat history stays anchored while editing.

**Settings Panels And Preset Prompts**
* Settings panels (Customize, Presets, Workspace, etc.) now narrow alongside the chat when the chat width is reduced, matching standard SillyTavern behaviour.
* Toggling a prompt on or off inside a preset no longer jumps the scroll position back to the top; the panel stays at the user's current scroll position.

**UI Icons And Provider Models**
* Replaced the Badge frontend icon with the pixel-art bunny badge shown in the latest reference image.
* Restored the Badge frontend icon to the original bunny artwork inside the peach pixel badge frame so the Shell Style preview no longer shows the distorted hand-drawn version.
* Added a Shell Style option to switch the frontend between the SillyBunny pixel icon and badge icon, including the splash screen, Home panel logo, favicon, and future system avatar messages.
* Aligned the Reverse Proxy preset row, Prompt Manager undo action, and OpenAI model favorite button with their neighboring dropdowns on desktop and mobile layouts.
* Added current OpenAI `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.5-pro`, Claude `claude-opus-4-7`, and Z.AI `glm-5.1` / `glm-5v-turbo` model choices to the backend dropdowns.
* Updated related OpenAI, Claude, and Z.AI capability handling so context, reasoning, media inlining, and Claude sampling rules stay in step with the added models.

**Settings And Browser Storage**
* Added a dedicated Clear cookies & cache utility action, wired through the cache-busted SillyBunny shell script so stale browser cache does not leave the button inert.

**Pathfinder And Release Metadata**
* Suppressed expected `AbortError` stack traces when Pathfinder sidecar generation is cancelled by its retrieval timeout or a closed client connection.
* Kept Pathfinder prompt action buttons from collapsing into icon-only controls by wrapping visible button labels in spans.
* Restored default Pathfinder tool toggles for existing template agents with empty tool definitions and made diagnostics report the last pipeline retrieval result.
* Added `SILLYBUNNY_USE_BUN=1 bash start.sh` as the launcher override for users who want to force Bun on ARM devices.
* Kept iOS WebKit chats pinned to the bottom while regenerated replies and post-generation agent refreshes update the latest message.
* Softened the idle send button glyph so the paper-plane icon no longer reads overly bright across themes.
* Prevented DeepSeek and other web tokenizers from failing when a Bun/ARM runtime exposes an empty server-side `location.href`.
* Updated app, Horde client, bundled extension, and package metadata to 1.5.3.

**Runtime And Upstream Sync**
* Aligned the startup init flow with SillyTavern 1.18 by moving the old post-install bootstrap into `src/server-init.js` and wiring launchers plus Docker startup through `bun run init`.
* Kept first-run default public-file synchronization additive so missing bundled files are copied without overwriting existing user files.
* Updated default configuration with upstream keep-alive, forwarded header, trusted proxy, private address whitelist, authentication rate-limit, and cache buster options.
* Added upstream runtime dependencies and npm install guards for safer package installation defaults.
* Pointed OpenAI Responses tests at `default/config.yaml` so they do not depend on mutable local configuration.

**Character Drawer**
* Reset character drawer tag grid placement and containment so inline tags stay inside their own character rows without overlapping adjacent entries.
* Made the character drawer X close the panel completely, added a dedicated back-to-list control for edit mode, restored inline tags in mobile grid view, and reduced the mobile header height.
* Restored mobile list-view character tags, hid the edit-only header after returning to the character list, hid the mobile hotswap strip while editing, compacted the mobile editor header, and kept the FAV/ADV controls readable on narrow screens.

**In-Chat Agents**
* Updated bundled Achievements Tracker reset defaults to use `[ACH|Title|Rarity|Description of the achievement]`.
* Updated bundled Scene Tracker reset defaults to use `detail: one-line sensory detail to set the current scene`.
* Prevented swipe navigation from re-running already-applied post-generation agents while preserving real new-swipe generation processing.
* Made Cancel Agent requests persist through in-flight manual runs, added a Cancel Agent action directly to running prompt-pass toasts, and prevented cancelled manual outputs from applying after they return.
* Added pre-generation prompt preview actions in the agent editor and eligible agent cards so macro-expanded prompts can be checked before sending.
* Let manual agent runs start independently in Parallel mode instead of queuing them behind other manual runs.
* Restored agent transform badges and undo/redo access after chat refreshes when the active swipe still has saved transform history.
* Deferred post-processing for new assistant messages while an agent is already working so users can keep sending or swiping without the older agent touching the newer message.

### v1.5.2 (2026-04-30)

This update brings Group Utilities into Launchpad, improves Moonlit Echoes and Guided Generations migration paths, restores Pathfinder access to contextual lorebooks, fixes group-chat continuity, and focuses heavily on mobile Safari chat stability.

**Launchpad And Extensions**
* Added SB-GroupUtilities to Launchpad optional installs, covering group presence, group greetings, shared group context, and SendAs utilities.
* Made the legacy Moonlit Echoes migration toast persistent until dismissed or opened, with a Show in Launchpad action that highlights the Moonlit Echoes Theme card.
* Added a Guided Generations fork notice that directs existing users to the SillyBunny-compatible fork in Launchpad.
* Updated bundled SillyBunny extension version labels to 1.5.2.

**Pathfinder**
* Pathfinder now includes active chat-bound, character, character extra, and persona lorebooks alongside manually selected lorebooks by default.
* Added diagnostics for manual/contextual lorebook counts and registered ToolManager tools, reducing false missing-source and enabled-tool warnings.
* Normalized candidate entry matching and added warnings when candidate JSON does not match loaded lorebook entry names.
* Added unit coverage for contextual Pathfinder lorebook merging and deduplication.

**Group Chats And Agents**
* Opening the Characters drawer during a group chat now jumps to the active group edit panel.
* Group Auto Mode now re-applies the saved global toggle when opening or creating group chats, while keeping the default off until the user enables it.
* Group DM history is included for the speaking character when returning to the main group chat without exposing private context to other speakers.
* Deleting a swipe clears pending post-generation recovery state so already-run post-generation agents do not fire again.
* Agent output history popups now use a scrollable desktop layout so long diffs keep Undo and Redo controls in view.

**Chat Naming And Workspace**
* Chat auto-naming now allows longer title responses and strips reasoning wrappers before parsing, making the Persona bottom-bar wand more reliable with reasoning models.
* Persona bottom-bar Auto-label Chat now uses structured title output when available and falls back to raw title parsing, preventing false `No message generated` errors.
* Workspace tabs and mobile shortcut options now place API immediately after Presets.
* CYOA Choices bundled regex now removes empty optional choice rows before rendering.

**Mobile Chat Stability**
* Added lazy/async loading hints for chat avatars and attached message images.
* Chat rendering now uses smaller mobile batches, ignores duplicate older-history touch/mouse activations, and contains off-screen messages to reduce WebKit layout and memory pressure.
* Mobile message updates now batch regex/HTML post-processing while keeping generation updates immediate.
* Streaming replies now patch formatted DOM in place, restore live formatted updates when stream fade-in is disabled, and reduce repeated swipe metadata cloning.
* Send flows now render user messages before slow handoffs, server ping, or group setup, then hold bottom scroll position to avoid iOS Safari send delays and snap-backs.
* Swipe navigation now anchors relative to the chat bottom and disables browser scroll anchoring on the chat scroller.
* New-message media scrolling now watches only visible media in the latest message and caps waits at 300 ms.

**Shell And Mobile UI**
* Fixed group speaker controls overflowing to the right when a typing indicator appears by allowing the desktop control row to wrap cleanly.
* The Bottom Bar Size slider now scales the SillyBunny chatbar and Persona bottom chat controls on mobile instead of only affecting the legacy composer sizing.
* Background Visibility now supports 100%, refreshes upgraded slider metadata, and keeps composer/chatbar surfaces readable at high visibility.
* Header, chatbar, composer, bottom chat surfaces, and Clean Minimal mobile drawer/menu panels now use solid layers in no-blur or high-visibility setups to prevent compositor artifacts.
* Mobile Workspace, navigation, Characters, and Quick Actions drawers now have tighter, more consistent spacing, safer bounds, and solid focused panels while keeping page context visible where intended.
* Characters drawer right-lock alignment now applies immediately on macOS desktop browsers and stays edge-flush on shorter windows without losing drag/resize behavior.
* Mobile Characters drawer layouts now use native shell bounds, safe-area gutters, aligned controls, and square avatars that avoid squeezing on narrow iOS-sized viewports.
* Mobile Top Bar Label option cards are left-aligned so checkbox, title, and helper text read cleanly in one-column settings layouts.
* Rotated the SillyBunny theme, tabs, and service-worker cache keys so browsers pick up the hardened surface styling immediately.

### v1.5.1 (2026-04-29)

This update restores Prose Polisher coverage for guided impersonation workflows, makes Advanced Formatting a first-class workspace tab again, adds conservative startup-loading improvements for desktop and mobile, and polishes cross-platform UI alignment, focus, safe-area, and touch-target behavior.

**In-Chat Agents**
* Added an opt-in prompt-pass condition for generated impersonation text so Prose Polisher can rewrite Guided Generations impersonations without mutating the previous assistant message.
* Shipped the bundled Prose Polisher template with impersonation polishing enabled, while keeping the new behavior off by default for other prompt-pass agents.
* Added editor UI and migration support for saved bundled Prose Polisher agents, plus unit coverage for both opted-out and opted-in impersonation behavior.

**Workspace And Formatting**
* Promoted Advanced Formatting into its own left workspace tab immediately after Sampling.
* Kept the Formatting tab visible across backends instead of hiding the whole Advanced Formatting drawer outside Text Completions.

**Loading**
* Deferred ordered classic library scripts, preloaded startup modules, and limited the mobile stylesheet to mobile viewports.
* Added a guarded service worker that stale-while-revalidates static library, CSS, image, and webfont assets while using network-first handling for HTML and JavaScript.

**UI Polish**
* Replaced clipped outer focus outlines and oversized active-control shadows with inset rings so focused and highlighted controls stay inside rounded containers.
* Aligned shell headers, character drawer padding, welcome headers, and checkbox labels across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
* Normalized mobile safe-area fallbacks and 44 px tap targets for the composer, bottom chat controls, and welcome recent-chat actions.
* Cleaned up redundant shell borders, trailing recent-chat stat dividers, and duplicated macOS browser chrome patches.
* Left-aligned SillyBunny shell drawer eyebrow labels, titles, subtitles, and descriptions across desktop and mobile.
* Contained shell close-button focus rings inside rounded borders so highlights no longer bleed past the control edge.
* Gave mobile Customize, Navigate, and Characters drawers a rounded native sheet treatment with a slide-up entry, handle pill, side gutters, and safe-area-aware header spacing.
* Stabilized mobile Recent Chats text sizing in WebKit with scoped text-size adjustment, stronger line-clamp bounds, and narrow-screen overflow guards.
* Tightened the mobile composer bottom spacing by removing duplicate safe-area padding and avoiding the forced 34 px fallback under the chat bar.

**Chat Management**
* Narrowed the Persona bottom chat bar on mobile with safe-area-aware side gutters while leaving the message composer width unchanged.
* Tightened mobile Persona bottom bar control heights, avatar sizing, icon buttons, gaps, and narrow-phone spacing so the bar no longer dominates the screen.
* Added Persona bottom bar shortcuts for mass deleting chats in the current character/group scope and asking the active LLM to name the current chat.
* Added aligned mass-delete checkboxes, protected the currently open chat, and included 7/30/90/180 day cleanup presets plus a matching `/autonamechat` command.

This patch also focuses on persistence and restart fixes for the new agentic and admin workflows introduced around `v1.5.0`.

**Chat And Reasoning**
* Persisted collapsed thinking/reasoning block state per message so user-expanded or user-collapsed reasoning blocks survive chat switches and reloads.

**Pathfinder**
* Added an independent Pathfinder enable switch in settings so saving books, modes, or prompt settings no longer toggles Pathfinder off unexpectedly.
* Preserved nested Pathfinder settings, including pipeline prompts, custom pipelines, book permissions, and tool confirmations, instead of resetting omitted fields back to defaults.
* Raised Pathfinder pipeline stage output limits from `1024` to `32000` tokens by default and exposed the stage max-token setting in both prompt editors.

**Server Admin**
* Fixed frontend Save & Restart and update restarts when launched from the provided Linux, macOS, and Windows launchers so the server relaunches in the same terminal instead of becoming a detached silent process.
